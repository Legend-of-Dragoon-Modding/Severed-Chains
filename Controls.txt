Controls for Severed Chains
---------------------------

While in menus, gamepad input will not work. The mouse is required to click on main-menu buttons. 
On the Addition screen, use mouse wheel to scroll between characters. 
On the Equip screen, use left/right arrow keys to change characters. "s" key to sort items/equips.
For more information on how mouse controls work, please read below.

~Keyboard~

Controls are currently hardcoded to the keyboard.

D-pad - arrow keys
Shape buttons - WASD
Start - enter
Select - space
L1 - Q
L2 - 1
L3 - Z
R1 - E
R2 - 3
R3 - C


~Gamepad~

This is a temporary, hacky implementation. In the future we will have full controller support. 
In general, Xbox controllers should work fine and mirror PS1 button mapping (A is X, B is circle, etc.). 

Important Notes:

- some controllers, such as old Wireless Xbox 360 controllers, do not have bluetooth and require a proprietary adapter to interface with PCs.
- PS4 controllers currently have mixed reporting. If they work for you, note that some inputs are scrambled.


~Mouse~

Mouse wheel and buttons are used for most of the navigation inside the Menus.

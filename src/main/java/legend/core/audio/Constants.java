   *     </pre>
   *     This is well beyond the two-octave shift limit of the retail engine and even the theoretical
   *     limit of ~4 octaves and 9.5 semitones (you can't shift further than the buffer length).
   *     <p>
   *     Dropping down to 26 might be beneficial if we want to support higher quality sound banks
   *     (e.g., modding). The two-octave shift will still fit with a 96 kHz sound bank.
   *     Higher sample rate sound banks often result in much cleaner pitch modulation because
   *     interpolated values are not only closer to the original sound bank values, but interpolation
   *     also occurs over smaller sections of the sound wave.

   *     </pre>
   *     This is the absolute limit of how far it can be pushed without converting the pitch counter to a {@code long}.
   *   </li>

   *   <li>
   *     <b>Bit shift of 31</b> — Can be used if a {@code long} is used for accumulation.
   *     This does not require more memory for lookups since only a single octave is stored,
   *     hence the maximal multiplier remains just below 2.
